fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Native-environments.html#page-description","fragment":"New in 0.49.0\nMeson has cross files for describing cross compilation environments,\nfor describing native environments it has equivalent \"native files\".\nNatives describe the build machine, and can be used to override properties of\nnon-cross builds, as well as properties that are marked as \"native\" in a cross\nbuild.\nThere are a couple of reasons you might want to use a native file to keep a\npersistent environment:\nAll of the rules about cross files and changed settings apply to native files\nas well, see here\nCurrently the only use of native files is to override native binaries. This\nincludes the compilers and binaries collected with find_program, and those\nused by dependencies that use a config-tool instead of pkgconfig for detection,\nlike llvm-config\nAs of 0.50.0 paths and directories such as libdir can be defined in the native\nfile in a paths section\nThese values will only be loaded when not cross compiling. Any arguments on the\ncommand line will override any options in the native file. For example, passing\n--libdir=otherlibdir would result in a prefix of /my prefix and a libdir of\notherlibdir.\nUnlike cross file, native files allow layering. More than one native file can be\nloaded, with values from a previous file being overridden by the next. The\nintention of this is not overriding, but to allow composing native files.\nFor example, if there is a project using C and C++, python 3.4-3.7, and LLVM\n5-7, and it needs to build with clang 5, 6, and 7, and gcc 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x;\nexpressing all of these configurations in monolithic configurations would\nresult in 81 different native files. By layering them, it can be expressed by\njust 12 native files.\nLike cross files, native files may be installed to user or system wide\nlocations, defined as:\nThe order of locations tried is as follows:\nThese files are not intended to be shipped by distributions, unless they are\nspecifically for distribution packaging, they are mainly intended for\ndevelopers.\n\nTo build with a non-default native tool chain (such as clang instead of gcc)\nTo use a non-default version of another binary, such as yacc, or llvm-config\n\n\n$XDG_DATA_DIRS/meson/native\n(/usr/local/share/meson/native:/usr/share/meson/native if $XDG_DATA_DIRS is\nundefined)\n$XDG_DATA_HOME/meson/native ($HOME/.local/share/meson/native if\n$XDG_DATA_HOME is undefined)\n\n\nA file relative to the local dir\nThe user local location\nThe system wide locations in order\n\n"});
