fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Build-options.html#features", "fragment": "Features \nA feature option has three states enabled disabled or auto. It is intended to be passed as value for the required keyword argument of most functions. Currently supported in dependency find_library find_program and add_languages functions. \nWhen getting the value of this type of option using get_option a special object is returned instead of the string representation of the option s value. That object has three methods returning boolean and taking no argument enabled disabled and auto \nIf the value of a feature option is set to auto that value is overriden by the global auto_features option which defaults to auto This is intended to be used by packagers who want to have full control on which dependencies are required and which are disabled and not rely on build deps being installed at the right version to get a feature enabled. They could set auto_features enabled to enable all features and disable explicitly only the few they don t want if any. \nThis type is available since version \n"});
