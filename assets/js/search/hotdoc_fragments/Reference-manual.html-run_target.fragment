fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Reference-manual.html#run_target", "fragment": "run_target \nThis function creates a new top level target that runs a specified command with the specified arguments. Like all top level targets this integrates with the selected backend. For instance with Ninja you can run it as ninja target_name. Note that a run target produces no output as far as Meson is concerned. It is only meant for tasks such as running a code formatter or flashing an external device s firmware with a built file. \nThe script is run from an unspecified directory and Meson will set three environment variables MESON_SOURCE_ROOT MESON_BUILD_ROOT and MESON_SUBDIR that specify the source directory build directory and subdirectory the target was defined in respectively. \n"});
