You still need something such as kconfig frontends see link below to parse your Kconfig files and then after you ve choosen the configuration options output a config file. \nThe module may be imported as follows \nThe following functions will then be available as methods on the object with the name kconfig. You can of course replace the name kconfig with anything else. \nThis function loads a kconfig output file and returns a dictionary object. \nkconfig.load makes no attempt at parsing the values in the file. Therefore true boolean values will be represented as the string y and integer values will have to be converted with to_int \nKconfig frontends usually have config as the default name for the configuration file. However placing the configuration file in the source directory limits the user to one configuration per source directory. In order to allow separate configurations for each build directory as is the Meson standard meson.build should not hardcode config as the argument to kconfig.load and should instead make the argument to kconfig.load a project build option. \nReturns a dictionary object. \n"});
