It is not as slick and may have bugs but at least it will allow you to use wraps. \nTo list all available wraps \nTo install a wrap go to your source root make sure that the subprojects directory exists and run this command \nThis will stage the subproject ready to use. If you have multiple subprojects you need to download them all manually. \nNote The tool was added in for versions older than that you need to delete the foo.wrap file to work around this issue. \nNuke the contents of subprojects and start again. \nSome repositories show up in the list but are not installable. They would not show up in the real WrapDB because they are works in progress. \nGitHub web API limits the amount of queries you can do to hour. If you exceed that you need to wait for the timer to reset. \n"});
