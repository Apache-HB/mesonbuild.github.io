The module has two methods.\nThis method takes the following keyword arguments:\nIt returns an opaque object that should be passed to a main build target.\nThis method generates the necessary targets to build translation files with lrelease, it takes the following keyword arguments:\nThis method returns true if all tools used by this module are found, false\notherwise.\nIt should be used to compile optional Qt code:\nThis method takes the following keyword arguments:\nSince: 0.54.0\nSee Qt dependencies\nThe 'modules' argument is used to include Qt modules in the project.\nSee the Qt documentation for the list of modules.\nThe 'private_headers' argument allows usage of Qt's modules private headers.\n(since v0.47.0)\nA simple example would look like this:\n\n\nmoc_headers, moc_sources, ui_files, qresources, which define the files that require preprocessing with moc, uic and rcc\n\n\ninclude_directories, the directories to add to header search path for moc (optional)\n\nmoc_extra_arguments, any additional arguments to moc (optional). Available since v0.44.0.\n\nuic_extra_arguments, any additional arguments to uic (optional). Available since v0.49.0.\n\nrcc_extra_arguments, any additional arguments to rcc (optional). Available since v0.49.0.\n\ndependencies, dependency objects needed by moc. Available since v0.48.0.\n\n\n\nts_files, the list of input translation files produced by Qt's lupdate tool.\n\ninstall when true, this target is installed during the install step (optional).\n\ninstall_dir directory to install to (optional).\n\nbuild_by_default when set to true, to have this target be built by default, that is, when invoking plain ninja; the default value is false (optional).\n\n\n\nrequired: by default, required is set to false. If required is set to\ntrue or an enabled feature and some tools are\nmissing Meson will abort.\n\nmethod: method used to find the Qt dependency (auto by default).\n\n"});
