Currently this is only supported on the Ninja backend. \nThe standalone find_library function has been a no op for a long time. Starting with this version it becomes a hard error. \nThere used to be a keywordless version of run_target which looked like this \nThis is now an error. The correct format for this is now \nNormally when generating files with a generator Meson flattens the input files so they all go in the same directory. Some code generators such as Protocol Buffers require that the generated files have the same directory layout as the input files used to generate them. This can now be achieved like this \nbinaries c usr bin arm linux gnueabihf gcc rust rustc target arm unknown linux gnueabihf C linker usr bin arm linux gnueabihf gcc \nThe compile_resources function of the windows module can now be used on custom targets as well as regular files. \nThe promote command makes it easy to copy nested dependencies to the top level. \nThis will search the project tree for a subproject called scommon and copy it to the top level. \nIf there are many embedded subprojects with the same name you have to specify which one to promote manually like this \nNormally project options are specific to the current project. However sometimes you want to have an option whose value is the same over all projects. This can be achieved with the new yield keyword for options. When set to true getting the value of this option in meson.build files gets the value from the option with the same name in the master project if such an option exists \n"});
