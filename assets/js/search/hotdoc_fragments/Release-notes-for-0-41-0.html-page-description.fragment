If not given its value defaults to the return value of meson.project_version \nThe ninja backend now quotes special characters that may be interpreted by ninja itself providing better interoperability with custom commands. This support may not be perfect please report any issues found with special characters to the issue tracker. \nThe Pkgconfig module object can add arbitrary variables to the generated pc file with the new variables keyword \nCreating distribution tarballs is simple \nThis will create a tar.xz archive of the source code including submodules without any revision control information. This command also verifies that the resulting archive can be built tested and installed. This is roughly equivalent to the distcheck target in other build systems. Currently this only works for projects using Git and only with the Ninja backend. \nTargets for building rust now take a rust_args keyword. \nCode coverage can be generated for tests by passing the cov argument to the run_tests.py test runner. Note since multiple processes are used coverage must be combined before producing a report coverage3 combine. \n"});
