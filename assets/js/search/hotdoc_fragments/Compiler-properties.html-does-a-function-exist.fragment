Sometimes you need to explicitly check if some function exists. This is how we would check whether the function open_memstream exists in header stdio.h \nNote that on macOS programs can be compiled targeting older macOS versions than the one that the program is compiled on. It can t be assumed that the OS version that is compiled on matches the OS version that the binary will run on. \nTherefore when detecting function availability with has_function it is important to specify the correct header in the prefix argument. \nIn the example above the function open_memstream is detected which was introduced in macOS When the user builds on macOS but targeting macOS mmacosx version min this will correctly report the function as missing. Without the header however it would lack the necessary availability information and incorrectly report the function as available. \n"});
