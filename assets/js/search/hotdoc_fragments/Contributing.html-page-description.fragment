The basic rule for this is very simple keep your pull request up to date using rebase only. \nDo not merge head back to your branch. Any merge commits in your pull request make it not acceptable for merging into master and you must remove them. \nEvery new feature requires some extra steps namely \nMeson s merge strategy should fullfill the following guidelines \npreserve as much history as possible \nhave as little junk in the repo as possible \neverything in the master lineage should always pass all tests \nThese goals are slightly contradictory so the correct thing to do often requires some judgement on part of the person doing the merge. Github provides three different merge options The rules of thumb for choosing between them goes like this \nsingle commit pull requests should always be rebased \na pull request with one commit and one fixup commit such as testing something to see if it passes CI should be squashed \nlarge branches with many commits should be merged with a merge commit especially if one of the commits does not pass all tests which happens in e.g. large and difficult refactorings \nIf in doubt ask for guidance on IRC. \nNo you don t. All contributions are welcome. \n"});
