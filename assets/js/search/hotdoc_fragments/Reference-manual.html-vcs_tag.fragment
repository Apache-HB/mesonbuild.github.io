This file is guaranteed to be up to date on every build. Keywords are similar to custom_target. \nMeson will read the contents of input substitute the replace_string with the detected revision number and write the result to output. This method returns a custom_target object that as usual should be used to signal dependencies if other targets use the file outputted by this. \nFor example if you generate a header with this and want to use that in a build target you must add the return value to the sources of that build target. Without that Meson will not know the order in which to build the targets. \nIf you desire more specific behavior than what this command provides you should use custom_target. \n"});
