fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Getting-meson.html#page-description", "fragment": "Meson is implemented in Python and requires or newer. If your operating system provides a package manager you should install it with that. For platforms that don t have a package manager you need to download it from Python s home page. See below for platform specific Python3 quirks. \nMeson releases can be downloaded from the GitHub release page and you can run meson.py from inside a release or the git repository itself without doing anything special. \nOn Windows if you did not install Python with the installer options that make Python scripts executable you will have to run python path to meson.py where python is Python or newer. \nThe newest development code can be obtained directly from Git and we strive to ensure that it will always be working and usable. All commits go through a pull request process that runs CI and tests several platforms. \nMeson is available in the Python Package Index and can be installed with pip3 install meson which requires root and will install it system wide. \nAlternatively you can use pip3 install user meson which will install it for your user and does not require any special privileges. This will install the package in local so you will have to add local bin to your PATH. \nWe provide an MSI installer on the GitHub release page that can be used to install both Meson and Ninja at once for Windows. It also contains an embedded copy of Python so scripts that use the Python module and do not have any external dependencies will continue to work as expected. \nPlease note that this is a new feature so bug reports are expected and welcome \nIn the most common case you will need the Ninja executable for using the ninja backend which is the default in Meson. This backend can be used on all platforms and with all toolchains including GCC Clang Visual Studio MinGW ICC ARMCC etc. \nYou can use the version provided by your package manager if possible otherwise download the binary executable from the Ninja project s release page. \nIf you will only use the Visual Studio backend backend vs to generate Visual Studio solutions on Windows or the XCode backend backend xcode to generate XCode projects on macOS you do not need Ninja. \nWhen installing Python it is highly recommended but not required that you select the installer options as follows \n\nWith this you will have python and pip in PATH and you can install Meson with pip. You will also be able to directly run meson in any shell on Windows instead of having to run py with the full path to the meson.py script. \nIf you are using MSYS2 on Windows as your development environment please make sure that you do not use the msys python package to provide Python Use either mingw32 mingw w64 i686 python3 or mingw64 mingw w64 x86_64 python3 depending on which MinGW target you are building for. \n"});
