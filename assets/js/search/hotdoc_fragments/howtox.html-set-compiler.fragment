fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "howtox.html#set-compiler", "fragment": "Set compiler \nWhen first running Meson set it in an environment variable. \nNote that environment variables like CC always refer to the native compiler. That is the compiler used to compile programs that run on the current machine. The compiler used in cross compilation is set with the cross file. \nThis behaviour is different from e.g. Autotools where cross compilation is done by setting CC to point to the cross compiler such as usr bin arm linux gnueabihf gcc The reason for this is that Meson supports natively the case where you compile helper tools such as code generators and use the results during the build. Because of this Meson needs to know both the native and the cross compiler. The former is set via the environment variables and the latter via the cross file only. \n"});
