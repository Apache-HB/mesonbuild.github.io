The following procedure is not yet approved for use \nMeson operates under the principle that trunk should in theory be always good enough for release. That is all code merged in trunk must pass all unit tests. Any broken code should either be fixed or reverted immediately. \nPeople who are willing to tolerate the occasional glitch should be able to use Meson trunk for their day to day development if they so choose. \nMajor releases are currently in the form X.0 where X is an increasing number. We aim to do a major release roughly once a month though the schedule is not set in stone. Prior to the release there is a stabilisation period of roughly a week. Major changes should not be committed during this time but instead only small scale fixes. \nBugfix releases contain only minor fixes to major releases and are designated by incrementing the last digit of the version number. The criteria for a bug fix release is one of the following \nIn these cases a bug fix release can be made. It shall contain only the fix for the issue or issues in question and other minor bug fixes. Only changes that have already landed in trunk will be considered for inclusion. No new functionality shall be added. \nThe process for requesting that a bug fix release be made goes roughly as follows \nThe request should contain the following information \nThere is no need to write a long and complicated request report. Something like the following is sufficient \nThe latest release has a regression where trying to do Foo using Bar breaks. This breaks all projects that use both which includes at least list of affected projects This causes problems for X amount of people and because of this we should do a bugfix release. \n"});
