The following procedure is not yet approved for use\nMeson operates under the principle that trunk should (in theory) be always\ngood enough for release. That is, all code merged in trunk must pass all unit\ntests. Any broken code should either be fixed or reverted immediately.\nPeople who are willing to tolerate the occasional glitch should be able to\nuse Meson trunk for their day to day development if they so choose.\nMajor releases are currently in the form 0.X.0, where X is an increasing\nnumber. We aim to do a major release roughly once a month, though the\nschedule is not set in stone.\nBefore a major release is made a stable branch will be made, and 0.X.0-rc1\nrelease candidate will be made. A new milestone for 0.X.0 will be made, and\nall bugs effecting the RC will be assigned to this milestone. Patches fixing\nbugs in the milestone will be picked to the stable branch, and normal\ndevelopment will continue on the master branch. Every week after after this a\nnew release candidate will be made until all bugs are resolved in that\nmilestone. When all of the bugs are fixed the 0.X.0 release will be made.\nBugfix releases contain only minor fixes to major releases and are designated\nby incrementing the last digit of the version number. The criteria for a bug\nfix release is one of the following:\nIn these cases a bug fix release can be made. It shall contain only the fix\nfor the issue (or issues) in question and other minor bug fixes. Only changes\nthat have already landed in trunk will be considered for inclusion. No new\nfunctionality shall be added.\nThe process for requesting that a bug fix release be made goes roughly as follows:\nThe request should contain the following information:\nThere is no need to write a long and complicated request report. Something like the following is sufficient:\nThe latest release has a regression where trying to do Foo using Bar\nbreaks. This breaks all projects that use both, which includes at least [list\nof affected projects]. This causes problems for X amount of people and\nbecause of this we should do a bugfix release.\n\nrelease has a major regression compared to the previous release (making\nexisting projects unbuildable)\nthe release has a serious bug causing data loss or equivalent\nother unforeseen major issue\n\n\nfile a bug about the core issue\nfile a patch fixing it if possible\ncontact the development team and request a bug fix release (IRC is the\npreferred contact medium)\n\n\nthe issue in question\nwhether it has already caused problems for real projects\nan estimate of how many people and projects will be affected\n\n"});
