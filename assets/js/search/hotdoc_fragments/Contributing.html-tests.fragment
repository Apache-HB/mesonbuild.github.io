Similarly bug fixes must come with a unit test that demonstrates the bug proves that it has been fixed and prevents the feature from breaking in the future. \nSometimes it is difficult to create a unit test for a given bug. If this is the case note this in your pull request. We may permit bug fix merge requests in these cases. This is done on a case by case basis. Sometimes it may be easier to write the test than convince the maintainers that one is not needed. Exercise judgment and ask for help in problematic cases. \n"});
