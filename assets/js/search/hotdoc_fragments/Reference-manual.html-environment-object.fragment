fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Reference-manual.html#environment-object", "fragment": "environment object \nThis object is returned by environment and stores detailed information about how environment variables should be set during tests. It should be passed as the env keyword argument to tests. It has the following methods. \nappend varname value1 value2 appends the given values to the old value of the environment variable e.g. env.append FOO BAR BAZ separator produces BOB BAR BAZ if FOO had the value BOB and plain BAR BAZ if the value was not defined. If the separator is not specified explicitly the default path separator for the host operating system will be used i.e. for Windows and for UNIX POSIX systems. \nprepend varname value1 value2 is the same as append except that it writes to the beginning of the variable \nset varname value1 value2 sets the environment variable specified in the first argument to the values in the second argument joined by the separator e.g. env.set FOO BAR sets envvar FOO to value BAR. See append above for how separators work. \nNote All these methods overwrite the previously defined value s if called twice with the same varname. \n"});
