fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Style-guide.html#naming-options", "fragment": "Naming options \nThere are two ways of naming project options. As an example for booleans the first one is foo and the second one is enable foo. The former style is recommended because in Meson options have strong type rather than being just strings. \nYou should try to name options the same as is common in other projects. This is especially important for yielding options because they require that both the parent and subproject options have the same name. \n"});
