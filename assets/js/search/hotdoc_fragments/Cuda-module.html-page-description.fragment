It is only provided as a technology preview. Its API may change in arbitrary ways between releases or it might be removed from Meson altogether. \nThe module may be imported as follows \nIt offers several useful functions that are enumerated below. \nSince \nReturns a list of gencode flags that should be passed to cuda_args in order to compile a fat binary for the architectures compute capabilities enumerated in the positional argument s The flags shall be acceptable to the NVCC compiler object nvcc_or_version or its version string. \nA set of architectures and or compute capabilities may be specified by \nA suffix of PTX requests PTX code generation for the given architecture. A compute capability given as A.B X.Y requests PTX generation for an older virtual architecture X.Y before binary generation for a newer architecture A.B. \nMultiple architectures and compute capabilities may be passed in using \nThe single word architectural sets All Common or Auto cannot be mixed with architecture names or compute capabilities. Their interpretation is \nThe supported architecture names and their corresponding compute capabilities are \nExamples \nNote This function is intended to closely replicate CMake s FindCUDA module function CUDA_SELECT_NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS out_variable list of CUDA compute architectures \nSince \nHas precisely the same interface as nvcc_arch_flags but rather than returning a list of flags it returns a readable list of architectures that will be compiled for. The output of this function is solely intended for informative message printing. \nThis will print \nNote This function is intended to closely replicate CMake s FindCUDA module function CUDA_SELECT_NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS out_variable list of CUDA compute architectures \nSince \nReturns the minimum NVIDIA proprietary driver version required on the host system by kernels compiled with the given NVCC compiler or its version string. \nThe output of this function is generally intended for informative message printing but could be used for assertions or to conditionally enable features known to exist within the minimum NVIDIA driver required. \n"});
