Here is a list of items to\ncheck in the review. If some item is not met it does not mean that the\npackage is rejected. What should be done will be determined on a\ncase-by-case basis. Similarly meeting all these requirements does not\nguarantee that the package will get accepted. Use common sense.\nReviewer: copy-paste this to MR discussion box and tick all boxes that apply.\n"});
