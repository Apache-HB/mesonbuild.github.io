fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "index.html#page-description", "fragment": "Meson is an open source build system meant to be both extremely fast and even more importantly as user friendly as possible. \nThe main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer spends writing or debugging build definitions is a second wasted. So is every second spent waiting for the build system to actually start compiling code. \nThere are two main methods of connecting with other Meson developers. The first one is the mailing list which is hosted at Google Groups. \nThe second way is via IRC. The channel to use is mesonbuild at Freenode. \nMany projects out there are using Meson and their communities are also a great resource for learning about what and what not too do when trying to convert to using Meson. \nA short list of Meson users can be found here but there are many more. We would love to hear about your success stories too and how things could be improved too \nAll development on Meson is done on the GitHub project. Instructions for contributing can be found on the contribution page. \nYou do not need to sign a CLA to contribute to Meson. \n"});
