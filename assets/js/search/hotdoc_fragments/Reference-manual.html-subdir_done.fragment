All steps executed up to this point are valid and will be executed by meson. This means that all targets defined before the call of subdir_done will be build. \nIf the current script was called by subdir the execution returns to the calling directory and continues as if the script had reached the end. If the current script is the top level script meson configures the project as defined up to this point. \nExample \nThe executable exe1 will be build while the executable exe2 is not build. \n"});
