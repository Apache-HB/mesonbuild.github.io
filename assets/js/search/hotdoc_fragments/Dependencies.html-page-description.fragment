On these systems dependencies must be compiled from source. Meson s subprojects make it simple to use system dependencies when they are available and to build dependencies manually when they are not. \nTo make this work the dependency must have Meson build definitions and it must declare its own dependency like this \nThen any project that wants to use it can write out the following declaration in their main meson.build file. \nWhat this declaration means is that first Meson tries to look up the dependency from the system such as by using pkg config If it is not available then it builds subproject named foo and from that extracts a variable foo_dep. That means that the return value of this function is either an external or an internal dependency object. Since they can be used interchangeably the rest of the build definitions do not need to care which one it is. Meson will take care of all the work behind the scenes to make this work. \nCUPS LLVM PCAP WxWidgets libwmf and GnuStep either do not provide pkg config modules or additionally can be detected via a config tool cups config llvm config etc Meson has native support for these tools and then can be found like other dependencies \nSome of these tools like wmf and cups provide both pkg config and config tools support. You can force one or another via the method keyword \n"});
