Visit the Build Environment page in the AppVeyor docs for more details.\nThe following statement is sufficient for meson to find Boost:\nNon-Docker Travis-CI builds can use Linux, MacOS or Windows.\nSet the desired compiler(s) in the build matrix.\nThis example is for Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) and C.\nGitHub Actions are distinct from Azure Pipelines in their workflow syntax.\nIt can be easier to setup specific CI tasks in Actions than Pipelines, depending on the particular task.\nThis is an example file: .github/workflows/ci_meson.yml  supposing the project is C-based, using GCC on Linux, Mac and Windows.\nThe optional on: parameters only run this CI when the C code is changed--corresponding ci_python.yml might run only on \"**.py\" file changes.\n"});
