We recommend using Docker to get a more-recent version\nof Ubuntu and installing Ninja, Python3, and Meson inside it.\nThis yml file is derived from the configuration used by Meson for\nrunning its own\ntests.\nFor CI on Windows, AppVeyor is probably\nyour best bet. Here's a sample yml file for use with that.\nFor Qt 5, add the following line near the PYTHON_ROOT assignment:\nAnd afterwards add %QT_ROOT%\\bin to the PATH variable.\nYou might have to adjust your build matrix as there are, for example, no msvc2017 32-bit builds. Visit the Build Environment page in the AppVeyor docs for more details.\nThe following statement is sufficient for meson to find Boost:\nYou can cheat your way around docker by using python as language and setting your compiler in the build matrix. This example just uses linux and c but can be easily adapted to c++ and osx.\nThis setup uses the beta group. It is not recommended but included here for completeness:\n"});
