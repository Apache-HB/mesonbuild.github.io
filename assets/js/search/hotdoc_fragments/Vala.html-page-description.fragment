A skeleton meson.build file for Vala looks like this \nYou must always specify glib and gobject as dependencies because all Vala applications use them. \nWhen dealing with libraries that are not providing Vala bindings a vapidir flag can be added to extend the search path for the current project. \nIn this case make sure that the VAPI name corresponds to the pkg config file. \nIf no pkg config file is provided you must use find_library. Usingdeclare_dependency is cleaner because it does not require passing both dependency objects to the target. \nSome Vala bindings do not need a corresponding pkg config file and dependency is unsuitable for resolving them. It s necessary to use find_library in this case. \nIf a library target is used Meson automatically outputs the C header and the VAPI. They can be renamed by setting the vala_header and vala_vapi arguments respectively. In this case the second and third elements of the install_dir array indicate the destination with true to indicate default directories i.e. include and share vala vapi \nTo generate GObject Introspection metadata the vala_gir option has to be set with the desired name. \nThe fourth element in the install_dir array indicate where the GIR file will be installed. The true value tells Meson to use the default directory i.e. share gir \nFor the typelib use a custom target depending on the library \n"});
