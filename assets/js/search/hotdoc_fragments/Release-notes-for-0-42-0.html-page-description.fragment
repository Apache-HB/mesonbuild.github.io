fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Distribution tarballs from Mercurial repositories \nAdd support for Genie to Vala compiler \nPkgconfig support for additional cflags \nAllow crate type configuration for Rust compiler \nCreating distribution tarballs can now be made out of projects based on Mercurial. As before this remains possible only with the Ninja backend. \nThe Vala compiler has an alternative syntax Genie that uses the gs file extension. Meson now recognises and uses Genie files. \nThe Pkgconfig module object can add arbitrary extra cflags to the Cflags value in the pc file using the extra_cflags keyword \nRust targets now take an optional rust_crate_type keyword allowing you to set the crate type of the resulting artifact. Valid crate types are dylib or cdylib for shared libraries and rlib or staticlib for static libraries. For more see Rust s linkage reference. \n", "url": "Release-notes-for-0-42-0.html#page-description"});
