As before this remains possible only with the Ninja backend. \nThe Vala compiler has an alternative syntax Genie that uses the gs file extension. Meson now recognises and uses Genie files. \nThe Pkgconfig module object can add arbitrary extra cflags to the Cflags value in the pc file using the extra_cflags keyword \n"});
