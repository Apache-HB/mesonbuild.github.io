You can of course replace the name cmake with anything else. \nThis function is the equivalent of the corresponding CMake function it generates a name package version file. \nExample \nThis function is the equivalent of the corresponding CMake function it generates a name package configuration file from the input template file. Just like the cmake function in this file the PACKAGE_INIT statement will be replaced by the appropriate piece of cmake code. The equivalent PATH_VARS argument is given through the configuration parameter. \nExample \nmeson.build \nmyProject.cmake.in \n"});
