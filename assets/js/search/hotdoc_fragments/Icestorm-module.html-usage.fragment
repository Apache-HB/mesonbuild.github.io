fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Icestorm-module.html#usage", "fragment": "Usage \nThis module provides an experimental method to create FPGA bitstreams using the IceStorm suite of tools. \nThe module exposes only one method called project and it is used like this \nThe input to this function is the set of Verilog files and a constraint file. This produces output files called projname.asc projname.blif and projname.bin. In addition it creates two run targets called projname time for running timing analysis and projname upload that uploads the generated bitstream to an FPGA device using the iceprog programming executable. \n"});
