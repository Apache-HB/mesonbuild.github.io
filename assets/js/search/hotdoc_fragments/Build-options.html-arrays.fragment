To limit the possible values that can used set the choices parameter. Meson will then only allow the value array to contain strings that are in the given list. The array may be empty. The value parameter specifies the default value of the option and if it is unset then the values of choices will be used as the default. \nAs of Dopt and Dopt both pass an empty list before this Dopt would pass a list with an empty string. \nThis type is available since version \n"});
