fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Creating-releases.html#page-description","fragment":"In addition to development, almost all projects provide periodical\nsource releases. These are standalone packages (usually either in tar\nor zip format) of the source code. They do not contain any revision\ncontrol metadata, only the source code.\nMeson provides a simple way of generating these. It consists of a\nsingle command (available since 0.52.0):\nor alternatively (on older meson versions with ninja backend):\nThis creates a file called projectname-version.tar.xz in the build\ntree subdirectory meson-dist. This archive contains the full\ncontents of the latest commit in revision control including all the\nsubmodules (recursively). All revision control metadata is removed.\nMeson then takes\nthis archive and tests that it works by doing a full compile + test +\ninstall cycle. If all these pass, Meson will then create a SHA-256\nchecksum file next to the archive.\nNote: Meson behaviour is different from Autotools. The Autotools\n\"dist\" target packages up the current source tree. Meson packages\nthe latest revision control commit. The reason for this is that it\nprevents developers from doing accidental releases where the\ndistributed archive does not match any commit in revision control\n(especially the one tagged for the release).\n"});
