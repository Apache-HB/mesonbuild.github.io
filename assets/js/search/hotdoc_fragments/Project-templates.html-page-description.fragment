This\nfunctionality can be accessed with the meson init command. A typical\nproject setup would go like this:\nThis would create the build definitions for a helloworld type\nproject. The result can be compiled as usual. For example it\ncould be done like this:\nThe generator has many different projects and settings. They can all\nbe listed by invoking the command meson init --help.\nThis feature is available since Meson version 0.45.0.\nWith meson init you can generate a build script for an existing\nproject with existing project files by running the command in the\nroot directory of your project. Meson currently supports this\nfeature for executable, and jar projects.\nIt is possible to have Meson generate a build directory from the\nmeson init command without running meson setup. This is done\nby passing -b or --build switch.\n"});
