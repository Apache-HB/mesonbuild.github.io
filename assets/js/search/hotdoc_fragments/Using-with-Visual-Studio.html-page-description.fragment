fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Using-with-Visual-Studio.html#page-description","fragment":"In order to generate Visual Studio projects, Meson needs to know the settings\nof your installed version of Visual Studio. The only way to get this\ninformation is to run Meson under the Visual Studio Command Prompt. The steps\nto set it up are as follows:\nIf you wish to use the Ninja backend instead of vs2015, pass --backend ninja. At the time of writing the Ninja backend is more mature than the VS\nbackend so you might want to use it for serious work.\nThis assumes the py launcher is in your PATH, which is highly recommended.\n(new in 0.52.0)\nYou will first need to get a copy of llvm+clang for Windows, such versions\nare available from a number of sources, including the llvm website. Then you\nwill need the llvm toolset extension for visual\nstudio.\nYou then need to either use a native file\nor set CC=clang-cl, and set CXX=clang-cl to use those compilers, meson\nwill do the rest.\nThis only works with visual studio 2017 and 2019.\nThere is currently no support in meson for clang/c2.\n(new in 0.52.0)\nTo use ICL you need only have ICL installed and launch an ICL development\nshell like you would for the ninja backend and meson will take care of it.\n"});
