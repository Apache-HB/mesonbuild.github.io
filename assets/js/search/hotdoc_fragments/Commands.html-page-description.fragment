fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Commands.html#page-description","fragment":"There are two different ways of invoking Meson. First, you can run it directly\nfrom the source tree with the command /path/to/source/meson.py. Meson may\nalso be installed in which case the command is simply meson. In this manual\nwe only use the latter format for simplicity.\nMeson is invoked using the following syntax:\nmeson [COMMAND] [COMMAND_OPTIONS]\nThis section describes all available commands and some of their Optional arguments.\nThe most common workflow is to run setup, followed by compile, and then install.\nFor the full list of all available options for a specific command use the following syntax:\nmeson COMMAND --help\nChanges options of a configured meson project.\nMost arguments are the same as in setup.\nNote: reconfiguring project will not reset options to their default values (even if they were changed in meson.build).\nList all available options:\nChange value of a single option:\n(since 0.54.0)\nBuilds a default or a specified target of a configured meson project.\nBuild the project:\n(since 0.52.0)\nGenerates a release archive from the current source tree.\nSee notes about creating releases for more info.\nCreate a release archive:\n(since 0.45.0)\nCreates a basic set of build files based on a template.\nCreate a project in sourcedir:\nDisplays information about a configured meson project.\nDisplay basic information about a configured project in builddir:\n(since 0.47.0)\nInstalls the project to the prefix specified in setup.\nSee the installation documentation for more info.\nInstall project to prefix:\nInstall project to $DESTDIR/prefix:\n(since 0.50.0)\nModifies the meson project.\nSee the meson file rewriter documentation for more info.\nConfigures a build directory for the meson project.\nThis is the default meson command (invoked if there was no COMMAND supplied).\nSee meson introduction page for more info.\nConfigures builddir with default values:\n(since 0.49.0)\nManages subprojects of the meson project.\nRun tests for the configure meson project.\nSee the unit test documentation for more info.\nRun tests for the project:\nRun only specific_test_1 and specific_test_2:\nAn utility to manage WrapDB dependencies.\nSee the WrapDB tool documentation for more info.\n"});
