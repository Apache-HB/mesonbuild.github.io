fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Feature-autodetection.html#page-description","fragment":"Meson is designed for high productivity. It tries to do as many things\nautomatically as it possibly can.\nCcache is a cache system designed to make\ncompiling faster. When you run Meson for the first time for a given\nproject, it checks if Ccache is installed. If it is, Meson will use it\nautomatically.\nIf you do not wish to use Ccache for some reason, just specify your\ncompiler with environment variables CC and/or CXX when first\nrunning Meson (remember that once specified the compiler can not be\nchanged). Meson will then use the specified compiler without Ccache.\nWhen doing a code coverage build, Meson will check for existence of\nthe binaries gcovr, lcov and genhtml. If version 3.3 or higher\nof the first is found, targets called coverage-text, coverage-xml\nand coverage-html are generated. Alternatively, if the latter two\nare found, only the target coverage-html is generated. Coverage\nreports can then be produced simply by calling e.g. ninja coverage-xml. As a convenience, a high-level coverage target is\nalso generated which will produce all 3 coverage report types, if\npossible.\n"});
