fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Subprojects.html#commandline-options", "fragment": "Command line options \nThe usage of subprojects can be controlled by users and distros with the following command line options \nwrap mode nodownload \nMeson will not use the network to download any subprojects or fetch any wrap information. Only pre existing sources will be used. This is useful mostly for distros when you want to only use the sources provided by a software release and want to manually handle or provide missing dependencies. \nwrap mode nofallback \nMeson will not use subproject fallbacks for any dependency declarations in the build files and will only look for them in the system. Note that this does not apply to unconditional subproject calls and those are meant to be used for sources that cannot be provided by the system such as copylibs. \nwrap mode forcefallback \nMeson will not look at the system for any dependencies which have subproject fallbacks available and will only use subprojects for them. This is useful when you want to test your fallback setup or want to specifically build against the library sources provided by your subprojects. \n"});
