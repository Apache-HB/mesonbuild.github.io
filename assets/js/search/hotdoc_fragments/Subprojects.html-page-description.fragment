fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Subprojects.html#page-description", "fragment": "Why must all subprojects be inside a single directory \nThere are several reasons. \nFirst of all to maintain any sort of sanity the system must prevent going inside other subprojects with subdir or variations thereof. Having the subprojects in well defined places makes this easy. If subprojects could be anywhere at all it would be a lot harder. \nSecond of all it is extremely important that end users can easily see what subprojects any project has. Because they are in one and only one place reviewing them becomes easy. \nThis is also a question of convention. Since all Meson projects have the same layout w.r.t subprojects switching between projects becomes easier. You don t have to spend time on a new project traipsing through the source tree looking for subprojects. They are always in the same place. \nFinally if you can have subprojects anywhere this increases the possibility of having many different possibly incompatible versions of a dependency in your source tree. Then changing some code such as changing the order you traverse directories may cause a completely different version of the subproject to be used by accident. \n"});
