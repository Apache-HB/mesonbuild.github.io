fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"External-commands.html#page-description","fragment":"As a part of the software configuration, you may want to get extra\ndata by running external commands. The basic syntax is the following.\nSince 0.52.0, you can pass the command environment as a dictionary:\nSince 0.50.0, you can also pass the command\nenvironment object:\nThe run_command function returns an object that can be queried for\nreturn value and text written to stdout and stderr. The strip method\ncall is used to strip trailing and leading whitespace from\nstrings. Usually output from command line programs ends in a newline,\nwhich is unwanted in string variables. The first argument can be\neither a string or an executable you have detected earlier with\nfind_program.\nNote that you can not pass your command line as a single string. That\nis, calling run_command('do_something foo bar') will not work. You\nmust either split up the string into separate arguments or pass the\nsplit command as an array. It should also be noted that Meson will not\npass the command to the shell, so any command lines that try to use\nthings such as environment variables, backticks or pipelines will not\nwork. If you require shell semantics, write your command into a script\nfile and call that with run_command.\n"});
