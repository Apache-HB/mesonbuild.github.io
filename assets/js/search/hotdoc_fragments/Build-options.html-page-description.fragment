In some cases it might be useful to have an option that has the same value in both of them. This can be achieved with the yield keyword. Suppose you have an option definition like this \nIf you build this project on its own this option behaves like usual. However if you build this project as a subproject of another project which also has an option called some_option then calling get_option returns the value of the superproject. If the value of yield is false get_option returns the value of the subproject s option. \n"});
