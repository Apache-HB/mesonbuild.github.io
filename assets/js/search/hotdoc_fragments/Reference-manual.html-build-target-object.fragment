fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Reference-manual.html#build-target-object", "fragment": "build target object \nA build target is either an executable shared library static library both shared and static library or shared module. \nextract_all_objects is same as extract_objects but returns all object files generated by this target. Since keyword argument recursive must be set to true to also return objects passed to the object argument of this target. By default only objects built for this target are returned to maintain backward compatibility with previous versions. The default will eventually be changed to true in a future version. \nextract_objects returns an opaque value representing the generated object files of arguments usually used to take single object files and link them to unit tests or to compile some source files with custom flags. To use the object file s in another build target use the objects keyword argument. \nfull_path returns a full path pointing to the result target file. NOTE In most cases using the object itself will do the same job as this and will also allow Meson to setup inter target dependencies correctly. Please file a bug if that doesn t work for you. \nprivate_dir_include returns a opaque value that works like include_directories but points to the private directory of this target usually only needed if an another target needs to access some generated internal headers of this target \n"});
