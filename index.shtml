<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Meson is an open source build system meant to be both extremely
fast, and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible.</p>

<p>The main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer
spends writing or debugging build definitions is a second wasted. So
is every second spent waiting for the build system to actually start
compiling code.</p>
